# quiver-node-reader
This app will be a reader for notes created from [Quiver NotebooksTags](http://happenapps.com/).
The goal of this project is to create an Express WEB server which will serve the notes directly from original files inside Quiver notes (example.qvnotebook).

### Main goal
* Read notes from [QVNOTEBOOK](https://github.com/HappenApps/Quiver/wiki/Quiver-Data-Format)
* Create a filterable list of all notes by notebook
* Support for TAG
* Search engine

### Motivation
As a WEB developer I'm mainly working on MacOS and using Quiver with my all mates team.
I'm currently switching on GNU Linux then Quiver is unfortunately not compatible with this system, as my team mates still working on MacOS and using this tool I need to have access of all our Quiver notes.
Currently the isn't any plan to make this tool writtable.

### Project technologies
To build this tool here is the following technologies which are used:
* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* React
* Redux

*I just planify and start this project, then currently it is the begining and there still are nothing in this repository.
I hope in few weeks there will be a first usable version, and why not, if you know some used technologies, have some help to make it great.*

### How-to start developping
* Clone git repository | *git clone https://github.com/Gulivertx/quiver-node-reader.git*
* Install node depandencies | *yarn* or *npm install*
* Run dev server | *yarn run dev* or *npm run dev*
